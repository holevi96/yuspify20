With the recent advances in search engine technologies, search is becoming more and more a central feature of digital interfaces in general and it is slowly overshadowing the importance of navigation and classic browsing in many domains. The field of eCommerce is no different. In fact, search is without a doubt one of the most important features in any eCommerce store. Depending on the types of products the store is selling, the size of their catalog, and the kind of audience they cater to the importance of search can vary somewhat, but it is generally true, that in most cases, fast and robust search functionality is a must-have for an online shop in 2016.
On top of the soft benefits of enhanced customer experience, these solutions also translate to cold-hard numbers and directly measurable revenue growth. When, for example, Screen Pages shared statistics about of 21 of its clients, they found that in all but one case, the average revenue that was generated from site search was significantly higher from visitors performing searches on the site. The most notable example has shown that even though less than 10% of the visitors were performing searches, close to 40% of the website’s total revenues came from those searchers. Knowing this, it comes as quite a surprise, that according to a few years old report by Econsultancy, only 15% of companies have dedicated resources to optimizing their site search experience, and 42% of the surveyed businesses do not have a person directly responsible for improving their search.

Obviously, most eCommerce companies have a lot to catch up on when it comes to search. In this article, I'll outline a few actionable ideas on how to improve the on-site search of eCommerce stores, what to look out for during configuration and what extra features to add for enhanced functionality.
1, The first steps evaluating your current solution
Evaluation is the first step of every improvement process. Therefore, you should carefully analyze the search functionality on your site and its effects on purchases, browsing, and your business in general. There are a lot of ways you can do this and several measurement metrics you can look at, but it is best if you start with going to the ‘Site Search’ section in your Google Analytics. (If, of course, Site Search is set up properly in GA. If it’s not, this should definitely be the first step in improving your search functionality.)
Here are some metrics that are useful to look at and you can derive meaningful insights from them as to what works and what to improve.
The effect of search on conversions (% of searchers who convert vs. % of non-searcher users who convert)
zero result search queries (what are the common search words that yield no results)
Highest volume search queries (could serve as a basis to improve, update your category structure, as well as for setting up business-focused ranking, if technically possible)
Impact of search on engagement metrics (e.g. bounce rate, time spent on site, page views, etc.)
CTR of search queries (a good indicator, whether your search yields really relevant results)
2, Faceted search
Faceted search should definitely be the first option you’d want to look at if your site has a larger product catalog or you sell products that are heavily differentiated by features and attributes (like consumer electronics or furniture).
Faceted search basically enables your customers to filter their search results by price, or other product attributes, such as manufacturer or any other functional property of the products being searched.

This is a functionality that aids customers immensely with product discovery and helps them to get familiar with the search space, i.e. to know what their actual options are. In this respect, this feature can have a sort of merchandising effect as well, as it gives the visitor a sense of how wide your product portfolio is and perhaps even provide them with information that’ll affect their final purchase decision.
3, Autocomplete, autosuggest, and autocorrect
These are actually separate features, but in general, they serve the same purpose, i.e. to guide the customer in their buyer’s journey straight from the point when they are entering a query into the search field.

Moreover, it is not always an easy task for the user to translate his goal into a query that is comprehensible for the site search. It is therefore proven that searching  quite contrary to the general conception – imposes a higher cognitive load on the user than browsing through a list of items. Autocomplete and autocorrect can alleviate this cognitive burden on your visitors and make their browsing experience smoother.
4, Map categories, parent categories and synonyms
This article mentions that another common search implementation mistake amongst eCommerce sites is that they require search query terms that use the site’s jargon. This means that searches only yield results if the user phrases the query the same way as the product titles and descriptions on the site are phrased.
Mapping product categories, parent categories, and common synonyms for the possible search terms can solve this problem and ensure that a user will not get a zero result page if he searches for "blow dryer" instead of "hair dryer", for instance.
5, Business-focused reordering of the search results
On an eCommerce site, accuracy is not the only factor that needs to be taken into account when setting up on-site search. You also have to optimize your search from a business perspective. In practice, this means going to your site and typing some of the most common queries into your search bar (based on the statistics that I've mentioned above) and checking how your highest margin or most important products rank in your results. This can be a problem, especially in the case of high-volume search terms.
Luckily, there are third-party tools available, that enable the site admin to manually set product and category weights in the search result ranking, so you can ensure, that your search is not only accurate but also serves your business interests best.
Another, albeit much more integration and development-heavy feature is the personalized ordering of products on search result pages. The SmartSearch feature in Gravity R&D's recommendation system is capable of such personalized ranking, among other features, such as personalized autocomplete.
6, Display your search bar in a prominent spot
This might seem like a no-brainer but still needs to be said that if you spend a lot of time and effort carefully optimizing your search, then you need to make sure that every user can find it easily.
A good example, that highlights the evolution of search is the two screenshots below from Amazon.com. You can see that while back in the day Amazon didn't really seem to have trusted its search, and it was not really a central element of the interface, nowadays it's virtually impossible to miss.

As the amount of data online grows at an increasing pace, search will become more and more important in every domain. Therefore, you should not be shy to spend time and effort on optimizing your on-site search, because just as recommendations and personalization, an excellent search functionality can help you immensely with getting the most out of your traffic.
