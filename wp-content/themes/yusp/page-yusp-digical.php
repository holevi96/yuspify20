                        Nowadays, consumers not only have certain expectations of the customer shopping process, but they also have greater control over what and where they wish to buy than ever before. With all the digital tools customers have at their disposal, they’re empowered with more choice and access to unprecedented amount of information. Today’s retailers need to effectively and consciously filter the information they present to their shoppers, and customers will honor the relevant shopping experience with their trust and loyalty.

                        Personalization engines are continually running A/B or multivariate testing. This is to improve their ability to resonate with an individual. A/B testing, as a method, can also be used for comparing two or more solutions against each other to determine which one performs better. Yusp’s personalization engine is unbeaten, so far as tested against 15 in-house systems and 14 third-party personalization engine solutions.
